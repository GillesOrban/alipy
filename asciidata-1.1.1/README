1. Installation
----------------
This is release 1.1.1 of the python module 'asciidata'.
For installation do the following procedure:

a. Build the executables:
-> python setup.py build

b. Run the unit tests
-> python setup.py test

There should be no problems with these test.
All should finish with an 'OK'.
None of them should end with a 'FAILED' and a
description of the test failure.

c. Install the module
-> python setup.py install

If you could proceed to here, you have succesfully installed
the package and now can work with it.


2. Documentation
----------------
The directory 'doc' contains the manual 'asciidata.tex'.
Via latex you can print this manual.
Visa latex2html you can convert it to html files
and browse them on your disk.

The identical manual is also available for download from the
home page of the asciidata module at:
http://www.stecf.org/software/PYTHONtools/astroasciidata/

There it can be downloaded in various formats (ps, pdf, html).


3. Inline documentation
-----------------------
A rich inline documentation exists in epydoc-style throughout
the whole module. The command:
 -> epydoc Lib/

  creates and stores this inline documentation in the directory
  './html', of course only if 'epydoc' is installed on your system.
  The inline documentation may be a good starting point for your
  own software development using the classes and methods defined in
  the  asciidata module.
